Course: Python for Data Analysis

## Engineering School Project

I have to analyse a dataset. This repository will contain:
- A PowerPoint explaining the ins and outs of the problem, my thoughts on the asked question, the different variables you created, how the problem fits in the context of the study.
- A code in python (Jupyter Notebook format):
  * Data-visualization (use matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh ...): Showing the link between the variables and the target.
  * Modeling: Using the scikit-learn library to try several algorithms, changing the hyperparameters, implementing a grid search, comparing the results of my models using graphics.
- Transformation of the model into an API of your choice (Django or flask).

I worked on two datasets.

This repository is composed by two notebooks, a presentation about my work on these two datasets, and the data.

## The First Dataset: Page Blocks Classification

The problem consists in classifying all the blocks of the page layout of a document that has been detected by a segmentation process. This is an essential step in document analysis
in order to separate text from graphic areas.

## The Second Dataset: Seoul Bike Sharing Demand

Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.
The dataset contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.
