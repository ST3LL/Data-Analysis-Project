# ESILV_S7-Python_for_Data_Analysis-Project_2022

## Engineering School Project

I have to analyse a dataset. This repository will contain:
- A PowerPoint explaining the ins and outs of the problem, my thoughts on the asked question, the different variables you created, how the problem fits in the context of the study.
- A code in python (Jupyter Notebook format):
  * Data-visualization (use matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh ...): show the link between the variables and the target.
  * Modeling: use the scikit-learn library to try several algorithms, change the hyper parameters, do a grid search, compare the results of your models using graphics.
- Transformation of the model into an API of your choice (Django or flask).


## The Dataset: Blocks Classification

"The problem consists in classifying all the blocks of the page layout of a document that has been detected by a segmentation process. This is an essential step in document analysis
in order to separate text from graphic areas."
